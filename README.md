## MFSLives - Sample VFS plug-in for Macintosh File System

This repository intended to maintain an *up-to-date* Macintosh File System(MFS) implementation, for people who interested in macOS file system development.

**TODO**: you may describe the implementation in details.

### Caveats

* This repository purely for learning purpose, thusly I may wrote comments heavily, in such case, to distinguish from the original author([Quinn "The Eskimo!"](http://anarchistturtle.com/quinn/www)), I uses `/** This is a comment */` comment style solely.
